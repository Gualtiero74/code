I created 3 different versions of the same project:

First version (static) Whitout Json
All HTML elements are created directly in the DOM and the files are saved in the project folder.

Second version (semi-static) Inlline-Json
All HTML elements are created dynamically using JavaScript. The videos and all the info are static (all present in the JS file).

Third version (100% dynamic) External-Json
All HTML elements are created dynamically using JavaScript. The videos and the related information are read from an external Json file
